Click on the "Create New API Key" button to generate your API key. Be sure to give your key a meaningful name, as you may need to identify it later.

#### Step 4: Store Your API Key

Once you have created your API key, be sure to store it in a secure location. You will need to provide this key when making API calls to OpenAI's services.

#### Step 5: Start Using OpenAI's Services

With your API key in hand, you can now start using OpenAI's services. Consult the documentation for the specific service you wish to use to learn how to make API calls.

That's it! You now know how to obtain an API key for OpenAI's services. Remember to keep your API key secure and do not share it with others.
